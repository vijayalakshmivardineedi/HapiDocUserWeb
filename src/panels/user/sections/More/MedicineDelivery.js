            price or with incorrect information due to an error in pricing or
            product information, HapiDoc Pharmacy shall have the right, at our
            sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any orders placed for that
            product, unless the product has already been dispatched. In the
            event that an item is mis-priced, HapiDoc Pharmacy may, at its
            discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order
            and notify you of such cancellation. Unless the product ordered by
            you has been dispatched, your offer will not be deemed accepted and
            HapiDoc Pharmacy will have the right to modify the price of the
            product and contact you for further instructions using the e-mail
            address/ contact no. provided by you during the time of

            cancellation.

            Please note that there may be certain orders that we are unable to
            accept and must cancel. We reserve the right, at our sole
            discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. Some
            situations that may result in your order being cancelled include
            limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies or

            our credit and fraud avoidance department. We may also require
            additional verifications or information before accepting any order.
            We will contact you if all or any portion of your order is cancelled
            or if additional information is required to accept your order. If
            your order is cancelled after your account has been charged, the
